# ChartAssembler (ChAsm)

ChartAssembler is (hopefully) a powerful and intuitive charting library that simplifies the way you create and maintain data visualizations. This project is built around a logical layer-based architecture which separates data manipulation from chart definition, giving the flexibility to craft everything from simple bar charts to complex multi-dimensional visualizations without writing a tangle of Python (or other) code. Whether you're prototyping a quick analysis or building production dashboards, ChartAssembler's composable approach lets you focus on only the functional details and let ChAsm handle the boring stuff.

## Getting Started

As of right now, this project is not published to any package managers. To use it: clone it, create a venv, run poetry install, and then use one of the listed Use Cases to learn the basics. As this project matures, this section will be expanded to include more detailed installation instructions.

## Filing Issues

Use the standard GitHub Issues tab to submit feedback to this project. My goal is to make this the most robust, flexible, and intuitive wrapper for building charts and that's only possible with community feedback.
